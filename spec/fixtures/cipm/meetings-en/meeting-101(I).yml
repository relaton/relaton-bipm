      With one abstention (Dr W.E. May), the CIPM approved the signature of the CIPM MRA by the ESA under the same criteria and rules applying to the other signatory international organizations.

      The CIPM and BIPM will increase their efforts to encourage signature of the CIPM MRA by other relevant international organizations (world-wide and from other regions). [Action CIPM/101-11]

      The BIPM will examine the level of participation in the CIPM MRA of each international organization signatory of the CIPM MRA so as to review if they should contribute financially to the operation of the CIPM MRA. [Action CIPM/101-12]
